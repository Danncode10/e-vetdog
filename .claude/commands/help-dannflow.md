# DannFlow Command Help

## How to Run Commands

Claude Code:

```text
/help-dannflow
/ask-command <plain-English intent>
/<command-name> [arguments]
```

Codex:

```text
/claude-command help-dannflow
/ask-claude-command <plain-English intent>
/claude-command <command-name> [arguments]
```

Codex uses `.codex/commands/claude-command.md` as a bridge. The source-of-truth command prompts stay in `.claude/commands/`.

## Notes

- `/help-dannflow`, `/ask-command`, `/seo-check`, `/marketing-check`, `/cleanup`, `/no-conflict`, and `/claude-flow-help` are report-only by design.
- Active rewrite commands say so in their own command prompt and should follow the project guardrails.
- Codex should use `/claude-command <command> [args]` to run Claude commands through the bridge.
